# Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are
# closest to the target.
#
# Note:
#
# Given target value is a floating point.
# You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
# You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the
# target.
# Example:
#
# Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, and k = 2
#
#     4
#    / \
#   2   5
#  / \
# 1   3
#
# Output: [4,3]
# Follow up:
# Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total
# nodes)?
