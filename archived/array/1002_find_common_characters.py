# 1002. Find Common Characters

# Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a
# list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (
# including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all
# strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in
# the final answer.
#
# You may return the answer in any order.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
# Output: ["e","l","l"]
# Example 2:
#
# Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
# Output: ["c","o"]
#
#
# Note:
#
# 1 <= A.length <= 100
# 1 <= A[i].length <= 100
# A[i][j] is a lowercase letter
