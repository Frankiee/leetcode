# Invert a binary tree.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#
#      4
#    /   \
#   2     7
#  / \   / \
# 1   3 6   9
# Output:
#
#      4
#    /   \
#   7     2
#  / \   / \
# 9   6 3   1
# Trivia:
# This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
#
# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a
# binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
